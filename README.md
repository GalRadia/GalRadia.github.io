# Inventory Management Documentation

## Overview
The Inventory Management system consists of three main components:
- **Flask Backend**: Handles database operations and API requests.
- **Android App**: Provides a user interface for managing inventory.
- **Android Library**: A Retrofit-based library to facilitate communication with the backend.

This documentation is divided into multiple files:
1. [Backend Documentation](/Docs/Backend.md)
3. [Android Library Documentation](/Docs/AndroidLibrary.md)
5. [Setup Guide](/Docs/Setup.md))

Each file provides detailed information on setup, usage, and functionality.
